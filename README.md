# my notes, delete before pushing
 
TODO:  
1. write the polygons to the database
since the api data likely won't change, we can just run it on once
 but store the code somewhere so we can run it again if we need to. 
  

2. Alter the filter function, or maybe mongoose has a way to do this,
to filter out the polygons that are not in the designated area

3. Get the filtered polygons and send them to the front end

4. stretch goal, maybe after midterm presentations: 
filter the locations based on given routes
 
Move this out of the route, and into a helper function
